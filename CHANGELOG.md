## [0.2.2] - Unreleased



## [0.2.1] - 2018-03-19

### Changed

* Set default behaviour on first launch to show the re-frame-10x panel instead of keeping it hidden. This will help people better debug their setup when they are configuring re-frame-10x.

### Fixed

* Bug where under certain rare circumstances relating to the structure of your app-db, the Event panel could throw an error when transitioning from one epoch to another.
* Refer to the correct Closure define to enable tracing [#170](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-10x/issues/170).
* Add missing requires in parts panel [#164](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-10x/pull/164)

## [0.2.0] - 2018-02-20

### Upgrade notes

* re-frame-trace has been renamed to re-frame-10x! To upgrade you need to do two things:
  * Update your dependency from `day8.re-frame/trace "0.1.21` to `day8.re-frame/re-frame-10x "0.2.0`
  * Update your preload from `day8.re-frame.trace.preload` to `day8.re-frame-10x.preload`. If you don't update the preload you will get a deprecation warning, reminding you to update it. 

## [0.1.22] - 2018-02-20

### Changed

* This is the final release of this project under the `day8.re-frame/trace` artifact ID. The only change from 0.1.21 is that this version will print a warning to the console every time you load it, reminding you to update to `day8.re-frame/re-frame-10x`.

## [0.1.21] - 2018-02-14

### Fixed

* Avoid throwing an error `No item 0 in vector of length 0` under certain circumstances.

## [0.1.20] - 2018-02-14

### Upgrade notes

To take advantage of the more granular timing info in this version, you will need to upgrade to re-frame 0.10.5.

### Added

* A time-travelling debugger. Navigating forwards and backwards through the event history updates app-db to match. Be careful when using this with a stateful backend; as in the movies if you change too much or go too far back, the future can become unpredictable.

### Improved

* Improve Timing panel to show more granular timing info.

### Fixed

* Settings panel has a scroll bar if your screen height is too small.

## [0.1.19] - 2018-02-09

### Changed

* Massive overhaul to how subscriptions are processed.
  * Subscriptions that exist but weren't run, now show up in the subscription panel.
  * Subscription creations and disposals that happen during figwheel reloads or otherwise outside of the re-frame event domino cycle are now correctly handled. If any of these happen, they show up in the new section Intra-Epoch Subscriptions.
  * All of the actions that happen to a subscription within an epoch are now shown. This lets you spot unusual behaviour like a subscription being created but not-run, or a subscription running multiple times.
  * Present better explanation messages when viewing the diff section for a sub where the value is unchanged, not run yet, or only run once.

### Fixed

* Garden source dependencies are now working if you don't have your own dependency on Garden.
* New app-db path inspectors default to `"""` instead of `"[]"` so you can see the help text.

## [0.1.18] - 2018-01-31

### Fixed

* Garden source dependencies now work if you don't have your own dependency on Garden.


## [0.1.17] - 2018-01-31

This version requires re-frame 0.10.4 to make use of the newly added Event panel.

### Added

* New event panel. This panel shows the coeffects given to your event handler, the effects your event handler produced, and all of the interceptors in the chain.
* Debugging instructions if re-frame-trace fails to start.
* Setting to drop low level traces. This reduces the memory overhead of re-frame-trace as we can drop more traces that you are unlikely to want most of the time.
* Diff the previous value of a subscription with its current value.

### Changed

* In the subs panel "Ignore **n** layer 2 subs" is now "Ignore **n** unchanged layer 2 subs". This is a more useful filter, as you can filter out noisy layer 2 subscriptions, while still seeing the changes that do happen to layer 2 subs.
* The version of Garden that re-frame-trace uses is now bundled as a source dependency so you should no longer get conflicts if you use Garden 2.
* Refactored re-frame-trace trace parsing internals to incrementally parse new traces.
* Clicking on a trace's expanded information now prints the entire trace to the console instead of just the tags.
* Improved efficency of rendering views that do not need to filter out view namespaces.
* app-db and subs panel now have a slightly more responsive design.

### Fixed

* External windows not loading
* All app-db and subscription path expansions are now independent of each other [#134](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/134).
* Layer 2/3 calculations are more accurate now. We now use the last seen layer level when a subscription runs, to inform it's layer level if it was created or destroyed.
* View namespaces that are ignored are no longer shown when showing traces for all epochs.
* Distinguish between subscriptions that return `nil` values and those that haven't run yet.
* Timing panel not showing elapsed event processing time.

## [0.1.16] - 2018-01-26

There is now a React 16 variant of re-frame-trace available under the version `0.1.16-react16`. If your application uses React 16 and Reagent 0.8.0-alpha2 or higher, this is the version that you will need to use.

### Added

* Setting to control how many epochs are retained
* Setting to reset all epochs
* Setting to ignore epochs
* Setting to filter out trace for views from uninteresting namespaces

### Changed

* Updated bundled re-frame version to 0.10.3, and bundled reagent version to 0.7.0. This shouldn't impact your project's dependencies as they are source bundled via [mranderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson).
* Add hyperlinks to docs

### Fixed

* Set a print limit of 400 characters in the event header, to prevent very large events from DOSing the host application.
* XML encode # character in SVGs, fixing [#130](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/130).
* Fix the reset tracing button in the traces panel.
* Fix a bug when there is only one traced event, re-frame-trace would allow you to go back an epoch, throwing an exception.

## [0.1.15] - 2018-01-24

### Added

* The app-db panel now has buttons to reset app-db to the state at the beginning or end of any epoch.
* The subscription panel shows subscriptions that were created and destroyed.
* The trace panel automatically filters traces to just the current epoch
* A new timing panel shows basic timing statistics around event processing and rendering. More to come here.

### Changed

* re-frame-trace is now organised around epochs. An epoch includes an event being processed, subscriptions running in response, and the view re-rendering.
* A new visual design language.

### Fixed

Lots of quality of life fixes:

* Lower count of items in sequence before expanding icon shows [#126](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/126)
* Only allow one time based filter at a time [#125](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/125)
* Persist trace expansions when changing tab [#105](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/105)
* Hide :sub/create traces for cached subscriptions [#93](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/93)
* Persist filter category settings to localstorage [#121](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/121)
* Highlight events in trace window [#106](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/106)

## [0.1.14] - 2017-12-19

### Added

* New state snapshotting feature: Click the camera to snapshot app-db, and click the load button to restore to your snapshot. Snapshots only persist for the browser session, they aren't available after reloading the browser.
* X button to remove app-db paths

### Changed

* Switched from LESS to Garden styles. Now interactive development and debugging of re-frame-trace is even faster.
* Reopen/reattach external popup windows when reloading host application
* Reorganise namespace layout and remove (hidden) subviz panel and D3 dependency. This may return in the future though.
* Only sort subscriptions by the subscription key, not the whole vector
* Visual tweaks

### Fixed

* Set panel width correctly so you can see the whole panel at all times. Previously the right edge was just off screen.

## [0.1.13] - 2017-11-23

**N.B.** To make the best use of the new subscriptions panel, you also need to update to re-frame v0.10.3-alpha1.

### Added

* Bright yellow text when re-frame trace is preloaded, but tracing is not enabled.
* Add preliminary subscriptions panel. Still a bit buggy and not very pretty, but it should be useful even in this state.

## [0.1.12] - 2017-11-16

### Added

* Preliminary support for React 16 component paths. [#89](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/pull/89)
* External popout window. [#92](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/92)
* Namespace aware truncation in the traces panel. [#100](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/pull/100)
* App DB expansions and contractions now persist across reloads. Note the [limitations](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/blob/master/docs/README.md#app-db-path-expansions) with this feature.

### Changed

* Hide index spans (the blocks next to each element counting the number of elements in a collection)

## [0.1.11] - 2017-10-27

### Changed

* Rename app-state panel to app-db
* Visual improvements to data viewer

## [0.1.10] - 2017-10-27

### Removed

* Subvis panel has been commented out while it is in a broken state.

## [0.1.9] - 2017-10-27

### Added

* Limit captured traces to a maximum of 4,000 to prevent performance slowdowns.

### Changed

* Speed up animations for autoscrolling to bottom of list
* Print full keyword for operation name

### Fixed

* Bad merge for handling window width changing.

## [0.1.8] - 2017-10-25

### Added

* Add a new App State panel. This lets you visualise your application state and inspect it. You can add multiple selections to view a subset of your application state.

### Fixed

* Handle window viewport size changing and other dragging bugs. This _should_ be the last of them, but open an issue if you still find glitches when resizing.

## [0.1.7] - 2017-09-25

### Changed

* Improve style resetting
* Visual improvements

### Fixed

* Fix panel resizing behaviour under edge cases

## [0.0.9] - 2017-05-02

### Changed

* The preloads namespace now adds the tracing panel to the DOM automatically, so you don't need to change any of your app code to bring it in. [#14](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/pull/14) via [Dexter Gramfors](https://github.com/Dexterminator).
  **Migration steps:** Remove any explicit rendering instructions for `day8.re-frame.trace/devtools` in your app, as this is automatically added now.

## [0.0.8] - 2017-04-13
